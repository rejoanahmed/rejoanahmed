#### The Problem: I Wanted My Mac Everywhere

I often find myself traveling or going on short hikes, and there are moments when I suddenly need access to my Mac — maybe to run a script, check logs, or grab a file. Carrying my Mac everywhere isn't always practical, so I started looking for a way to use my Mac remotely from my phone.

Naturally, my first thought was [SSH](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol).

#### Step 1: SSH Into macOS (The Local Way)

SSH is built into macOS and is surprisingly easy to enable. Here's how to set it up securely:

1. Open **System Settings → General → Sharing**
2. Turn on **Remote Login**
3. Allow access only for your user
4. **Disable password-based login** (critical for security)
5. Use SSH key-based authentication only

For detailed instructions, check Apple's [official documentation on Remote Login](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-a-remote-computer-to-access-your-mac-mchlp1066/mac).

On my iPhone, I used [Termius](https://www.termius.com/), which is an excellent SSH client available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/termius-ssh-client/id549039908). It's free, well-designed, and supports key-based authentication out of the box.

After adding my Mac's local IP address to Termius, everything worked perfectly.

…until I left my home Wi-Fi.

#### The Limitation: SSH Is Local by Default

By default, SSH only works when:

- Your phone and Mac are on the same local network
- Or your Mac is publicly exposed (which is risky if done wrong)

Port forwarding my home router felt like a bad idea. Not only does it expose your network to potential attacks, but it also requires router configuration that can break with network changes. I wanted something:

- Secure by default
- Zero-config
- Device-only access
- No router tinkering required

That's when I finally gave [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) a real try.

#### Step 2: Enter Tailscale (Mesh VPN Magic)

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) creates a private mesh VPN using [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), one of the most secure and performant VPN protocols available. Only devices logged into your account can see and talk to each other — it's like having a private network that follows you everywhere.

**What I did:**

1. Installed [Tailscale on my Mac](https://tailscale.com/download) (free tier is more than enough)
2. Installed [Tailscale on my iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1470499037) from the App Store
3. Logged into the same account on both devices
4. Enabled Tailscale on both

That's it. No configuration, no port forwarding, no router changes.

Instantly, both devices received private IPs in the `100.x.x.x` range:

```bash
100.x.x.x
```

These IPs are:

- **Not public** — they don't exist on the public internet
- **Not reachable by strangers** — only your Tailscale devices can see them
- **Only accessible inside your Tailscale network** — creating a secure tunnel between your devices

Tailscale uses [NAT traversal](https://tailscale.com/kb/1082/how-nat-traversal-works/) to automatically connect devices, even through firewalls and NATs. It's genuinely impressive technology.

#### Step 3: SSH Over Tailscale

Now the final step was trivial:

1. I found my Mac's Tailscale IP in the Tailscale app (or via `tailscale ip` in Terminal)
2. Replaced my local IP in Termius with the Tailscale IP
3. Kept SSH key-based authentication (no changes needed)
4. Connected from anywhere — mobile data, public Wi-Fi, coffee shops, anywhere

It just worked. No port forwarding, no router configuration, no security concerns. Just secure SSH access from anywhere in the world.

**Pro tip:** You can also use your Mac's hostname instead of the IP. Tailscale provides [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/) which makes your devices accessible by name (e.g., `my-mac.tailscale-name.ts.net`).

#### Why This Setup Is So Good

🔐 **No open ports** — Your router stays closed, reducing attack surface

🧠 **No router configuration** — Works behind any firewall or NAT

📱 **Works perfectly from phone** — Termius + Tailscale = mobile terminal access

🌍 **Secure access from anywhere** — Coffee shops, airports, hotels — anywhere with internet

⚡ **Near-zero latency** — WireGuard is fast, and Tailscale routes traffic efficiently

🔒 **End-to-end encryption** — All traffic is encrypted using WireGuard's proven cryptography

💰 **Free tier is generous** — Personal use is free for up to 100 devices

This is one of those setups that feels obviously correct once you try it. It's secure, simple, and just works.

#### Final Thoughts

SSH was never the hard part.
Secure networking was.

Tailscale solves that problem so cleanly that it almost feels boring — which is exactly what you want from security tools. The best security is invisible security.

**What you need to get started:**

- [Tailscale account](https://login.tailscale.com/start) (free)
- [Tailscale for macOS](https://tailscale.com/download)
- [Tailscale for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1470499037)
- [Termius for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/termius-ssh-client/id549039908) (or any SSH client)

If you haven't tried it yet, this might be the perfect excuse. It takes about 5 minutes to set up and you'll wonder how you lived without it.

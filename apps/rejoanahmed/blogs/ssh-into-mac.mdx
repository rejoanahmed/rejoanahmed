#### The Problem: I Wanted My Mac Everywhere

I often find myself traveling or going on short hikes, and there are moments when I suddenly need access to my Mac — maybe to run a script, check logs, or grab a file. Carrying my Mac everywhere isn't always practical, so I started looking for a way to use my Mac remotely from my phone.

Naturally, my first thought was SSH.

#### Step 1: SSH Into macOS (The Local Way)

SSH is built into macOS and is surprisingly easy to enable.

1. Open **System Settings → General → Sharing**
2. Turn on **Remote Login**
3. Allow access only for your user
4. **Disable password-based login**
5. Use SSH key-based authentication only

On my iPhone, I used Termius, which is an excellent SSH client available on the App Store.
After adding my Mac's local IP address to Termius, everything worked perfectly.

…until I left my home Wi-Fi.

#### The Limitation: SSH Is Local by Default

By default, SSH only works when:

- Your phone and Mac are on the same local network
- Or your Mac is publicly exposed (which is risky if done wrong)

Port forwarding my home router felt like a bad idea. I wanted something:

- Secure by default
- Zero-config
- Device-only access

That's when I finally gave Tailscale a real try.

#### Step 2: Enter Tailscale (Mesh VPN Magic)

Tailscale creates a private mesh VPN using WireGuard.
Only devices logged into your account can see and talk to each other.

What I did:

1. Installed Tailscale on my Mac
2. Installed Tailscale on my iPhone
3. Logged into the same account on both devices
4. Enabled Tailscale

Instantly, both devices received private IPs like:

```bash
100.x.x.x
```

These IPs are:

- Not public
- Not reachable by strangers
- Only accessible inside your Tailscale network

#### Step 3: SSH Over Tailscale

Now the final step was trivial:

1. I replaced my local IP in Termius with the Tailscale IP
2. Kept SSH key-based authentication
3. Connected from anywhere — mobile data, public Wi-Fi, anywhere

It just worked.

#### Why This Setup Is So Good

🔐 No open ports

🧠 No router configuration

📱 Works perfectly from phone

🌍 Secure access from anywhere

⚡ Near-zero latency

This is one of those setups that feels obviously correct once you try it.

#### Final Thoughts

SSH was never the hard part.
Secure networking was.

Tailscale solves that problem so cleanly that it almost feels boring — which is exactly what you want from security tools.

If you haven't tried it yet, this might be the perfect excuse.
